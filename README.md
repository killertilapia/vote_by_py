# With Python, we Vote

So you can't decide who to vote for the 2019 Midterm elections.  Why not let Python select who to vote for. 

With Python, we Vote!

# Running

1. pipenv install
2. pipenv shell
3. Run Python script
```
$ python vote_by_py.py
```

To see options
```
$ python vote_by_py.py --help
```

# Disclaimer!!!!

This is just fun Python script. If you actually used this to vote, you're nuts.
